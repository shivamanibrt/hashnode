Hey guys my name is **Shivamani** aka "**Aayush**" in this blog I am going to explain JavaScript where I will try to explain almost everything about JS concepts and language. 

Let's start with javascript fundamental 

<h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
Ans: Javascript is a **High-level**, *Object- Oriented*, **Multi paradigm** programming language. 
- **High-level**: We don't have to worry about complex stuff such as memory management.
- **Object-Oriented**: Based on an Object for storing Most kinds of Data.
- **Multi-Paradigm**: We can use different style f programming. 

<p>The role of javascript in web development is it adds logical parts to the website. </p>

<h3> How can we link the javascript file </h3>
Well, There are 2 ways you can write the JS code in HTML documents either you can directly write the code in an HTML file or link an external file. I personally prefer to link it externally because it reduces error, and complexity and makes code readable.  
inside the body tag use script and source file. 

for eg:
