CSS pictures should only be used for decoration.

With a meaningful text fall-back, a picture in HTML is designed to give visual significance in context. For browsers and web crawlers, using an A element with no content should be avoided since its content will have a relationship with the link (such as a Google bot). 

Here is a quick representation of the Cover image using CSS and How we can make our website attractive

1)   we have to use the (background-image) property in CSS to upload the image as Cover.

- height:90vh [ If we don't mention height property then the image will only display where the content is present]

- background-size: cover[ This stops the overflow and attaches the picture to make it possibly center the image]
