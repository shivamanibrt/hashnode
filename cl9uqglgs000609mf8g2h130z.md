Hey guys I am back!

<h2>Let's start with the difference between Value and variable</h2>

**Value** is a piece of data while the **variable** is a container that can hold a value and it can vary many times. 

For eg: 
console. log(12) // Here 12 is printed in the console which is the **value**.

let firstName = 'Aayush' ;
Here firstName is a variable because it can store the value Aayush and as discussed above firstName can be changed to only name.

<h2>Difference between let, const, var</h2>

1. **let,** is used to assign the variable which can be changed later on

for eg: **let myfirstJob = 'Teacher'**
if you remember your first job was not as a teacher but assistant teacher then you can simply write  **myfirstJob = 'assistant teacher'** and you don't need to use the let keyword again because you already assigned it once. 
***Note:***
- **a) let variable can be assigned empty and later used**

- **b) you can change the value of the variable anytime**

- **c) It is only accessed via its scope**

*here, myfirstJob is only accessed inside this myFunction*

2. **var**, it's the same as let all the functions are also the same but the only difference is var element can be accessed outside the scope so I recommend using let instead of var.


**const**, It is another very important assignment operator in Javascript.
Note:
- **a) You cannot leave the const variable empty** it will print an error

- **b) once the value to the variable is assigned it cannot be changed**

- **c) You cannot assign the same variable to another value meaning it can be only used once**

Thankyou. see you in the next blog post if you have any questions please don't forget to comment.
