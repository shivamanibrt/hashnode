The function is a simple piece of code that can be used again and again it looks like a variable but is actually a piece of code.  

There are 3 types of function 
1. Function declaration.
2. Function expression.
3. Arrow function.

<h2>1. Let's have a look at Function declaration</h2>

**How to write it? **

<h4>A function declaration is simply declaring the function with a name and if you want to pass a parameter inside you can use it inside brackets.  </h4>

*Note: Function declaration can be called even before creating it. Meaning you can call the function name first and then you can create a function with the same name. This is because of Hoisting*

<h2>2. Let's have a look at Function expression</h2>

It is simply a function that can be written as an expression. 

**How to write it? **

Again here it's similar if you want to pass a parameter you simply pass inside the bracket same as the function declaration. 
you simply can use the return keyword to return the output.  
*Note: The only difference between function declaration and expression is this function cannot be called before declaring it because hoisting is not applied to this. 
It is a good practice to use function expression to avoid bugs and errors because you need to declare all the functions before assigning the value*

<h2>3. Let's have a look at the Arrow function</h2>
The arrow function is simply the shorter form of the function made in ES6 to write it easily.

*Note: In the arrow function If the argument is 1 liner then you don't have to use the return keyword but if the arguments inside the body are more than 1 line then use the return keyboard to return the value.*

**Important: All function have their own use a declaration can be declared even before it is actually created while a function expression can only be called once it is created and an arrow function also cannot be called before it is created. **
